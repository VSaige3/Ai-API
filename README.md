# Ai-API
For science fair, the API for adding, processing, and training on data.
<b>NOT FINISHED!</b>
There are some rules about adding data.
the paths in the XML file API-metadata should be paths to databases, of which there is currently only one.
I may be dumb and have formatted it wrong, but the formats go something like this:

<p>
<H2>metadata-format:</H2>
<br/>
should include the fields <code>(METADATA_DPATH), (FILEDATA_DPATH), (DBMETA_DPATH), (DATABASE_PATH), (SETTINGS)</code><br/>
<b>warning: </b>
<i>do not use this one much because I will probably end support for it soon (too redundant)</i>
</p>

<h2>API-metadata</h2>
if you are just doin practical stuff, or even not practical developer stuff, you should not need to mess with this file. There are functions in the command line that let you do this without the trouble of messing it up.
